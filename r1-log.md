## Log

### R1D1 
Studied how to deploy my devops-maturity-metrics app in k8s along with etcd sidecar backend. Deployed it into my dev cluster and and X5 cluster. Need to figure out how to add it monitored by Prometheus Operator

### R1D2
Struggled with Python on my Mac. Successfully replaced default Python2 with Python3 and launched sample BotFramework echo bot. Next step is to determine how does it work and change behavior.
